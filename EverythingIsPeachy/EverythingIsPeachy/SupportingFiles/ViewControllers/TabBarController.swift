//## List Items Screen
//
//- Display a list of data from an API (call these "Things").
//- The navigation title should tell the user what kind of Things they are receiving from online.
//- Entering text in the search bar searches for and displays relevant Things.
//- Have a favorite button in each cell.
//- Tapping the favorite button should fill the UI and make a call to favorite for that Thing in the backend. Animate this UI change.
//- Selecting a cell should segue to a detail View Controller that displays additional information about that Thing.
//- The navigation bar should have an item that allows the user to log out.
