//## Favorite Items Screen
//
//- Display a list of Things that have been favorited by the user.
//- The navigation title should tell the user what kind of Things they have favorited.
//- Each cell should contain a favorite button which the user can tap to unfavorite the Thing. Tapping the button should change both the UI and the backend.
//- The navigation bar should have an item that allows the user to log out.
